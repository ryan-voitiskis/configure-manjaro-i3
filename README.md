# configure-manjaro-i3

Configure a fresh installation of Manjaro i3 the way I like it without the hassle.
DPI will have to be set manually after running the script as per appropriate for device.
Work in progress.

`git clone https://github.com/ryan-voitiskis/configure-manjaro-i3`

`cd configure-manjaro-i3`

`sudo bash install.sh`
